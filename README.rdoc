TactfulTokenizer is a Ruby library for high quality sentence
tokenization. It uses a Naive Bayesian statistical model, and
is based on Splitta[http://code.google.com/p/splitta/], but 
has support for '?' and '!' as well as primitive handling of 
XHTML markup. Better support for XHTML parsing is coming shortly.

Additionally supports unicode text tokenization.

== Usage

 require "tactful_tokenizer"
 m = TactfulTokenizer::Model.new
 m.tokenize_text("Here in the U.S. Senate we prefer to eat our friends. Is it easier that way? <em>Yes.</em> <em>Maybe</em>!")
 #=> ["Here in the U.S. Senate we prefer to eat our friends.", "Is it easier that way?", "<em>Yes.</em>", "<em>Maybe</em>!"]

The input text is expected to consist of paragraphs delimited
by line breaks.

== Installation
  gem install tactful_tokenizer
